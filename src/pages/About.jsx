        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          CulinaryConnect was born from a simple idea: sharing the joy of cooking. We noticed how scattered and disorganized online recipes could be, and how difficult it was to collaborate on a dish with friends or family. We envisioned a central hub where culinary enthusiasts could easily create, share, and discover amazing recipes, all while connecting with a vibrant community. That vision became CulinaryConnect.
